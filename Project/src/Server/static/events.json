On that day a big stage was made in the college playground and a canopy was raised overhead. Hundreds of chairs were arranged in rows for the audience. It was indeed an event of great joy and festivity for the students as well as for the teachers. The program was scheduled to be started at 4 PM.

The function started on time with the recitation from the holy Quran. Our English teacher Mr. Harun anchored the program and our principal",
